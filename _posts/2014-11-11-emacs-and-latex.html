<p>
Recently, I've had to use Latex for the first time in a while (other than very minor things). Notably, I'm using Emacs, as opposed to some of the other editors I've used in the past, from the simple (Sublime Text), to full-on IDEs, to a Frankenstein most of the two (LyX), and Emacs definitely has the best of both worlds. While I'm sure there is much more to learn, the maximum bang-for-the-buck that I've gotten is from <code>latex-preview-pane</code>:

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(use-package latex-preview-pane
  :commands latex-preview-pane-mode
  :diminish latex-preview-pane-mode
  :init (add-hook 'LaTeX-mode-hook
                  '(lambda ()
                     (delete-other-windows)
                     (latex-preview-pane-mode))))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
When you open a <code>.tex</code> file, another window is opened with the preview (in <code>doc-view-mode</code>) and the preview is refreshed every time the file is saved.
