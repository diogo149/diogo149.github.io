<p>
Recently, I've had to use Latex for the first time in a while (other than very minor things). Notably, I'm using Emacs, as opposed to some of the other editors I've used in the past, from the simple (Sublime Text), to full-on IDEs, to a Frankenstein most of the two (LyX), and Emacs definitely has the best of both worlds. While I'm sure there is much more to learn, the maximum bang-for-the-buck that I've gotten is from <code>latex-preview-pane</code>:

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">  <span style="color: #8c8c8c;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">use-package</span> <span style="color: #D0372D;">latex-preview-pane</span>
    <span style="color: #006FE0;">:commands</span> latex-preview-pane-mode
    <span style="color: #006FE0;">:diminish</span> latex-preview-pane-mode
    <span style="color: #006FE0;">:init</span> <span style="color: #8c8c8c;">(</span>add-hook 'LaTeX-mode-hook
                    '<span style="color: #8c8c8c;">(</span>lambda <span style="color: #8c8c8c;">()</span>
                       <span style="color: #8c8c8c;">(</span>delete-other-windows<span style="color: #8c8c8c;">)</span>
                       <span style="color: #8c8c8c;">(</span>latex-preview-pane-mode<span style="color: #8c8c8c;">))))</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
When you open a <code>.tex</code> file, another window is opened with the preview (in <code>doc-view-mode</code>) and the preview is refreshed every time the file is saved.
