<p>
I decided to migrating bookmarks from Firefox to org-more for multiple reasons (it's easier to add metadata, open them with different browsers, search, etc.). I started out simply copy-pasting the title, then the url, and maybe open the link to remember what it is and add some metadata into a hierarchical org-mode list, but it seemed incredibly repetitive.
</p>

<p>
I then tried exporting the bookmarks, but the output file was some ugly html. Rather than try to read it, I opened it up in a browser and saw a nice representation of what I'd love to copy into org-mode, though there wouldn't be an easy way to copy links. Now, I could have opened the html file in some REPL (Python, Clojure, etc.) and parsed out the titles and links, but I was hoping for something easier. I also could have used JavaScript to print the links out on the screen, but then I'd still have to format it after I copied it into Emacs. And even if I didn't, that's still too much work.

What I ended up doing was opening the html file with eww, and wrote a function that copies the title and the link into the right format (using the same functions I use when editing text). Here are the functions:

A few minutes later, I had all my bookmarks in Emacs. How people can live with text editors without a browser is beyond me (just kidding).
