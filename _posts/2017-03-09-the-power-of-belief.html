<p>
No, this is not about religion.
</p>

<p>
This is about <a href="http://blog.dilbert.com/post/102964992706/goals-vs-systems">systems</a>. One pattern that I've noticed when helping others with their systems is that believing (as in truly without-a-doubt believing) is key to success. When you doubt a system, you end of questioning it's worth, and this makes it so much harder to stick to.
</p>

<p>
For example, exercise. A common problem for people I exercise with is feature creep. We start off with a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Body-Science-Research-Strength-Training/dp/0071597174">simple and effective routine</a>, but then think: "We're missing X, let's do it", "I think I could do Y more", "It doesn't feel like we're doing enough", etc. There's always more to do, though. What started out as a simple effective routine might end up much more complicated, ineffective, and time consuming than intended.  The solution is belief in the system.

<p>
A more recent example is that I've been trying the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">Pomodoro Technique</a>. I've tried it before, and I was underwhelmed<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>. Recently though, I've been convinced that it made a lot of sense, and sure enough, have been extremely successful with it (so far).
</p>

<p>
I'm probably the most skeptical person I know, but it would be foolish not to acknowledge the power of blind faith.
