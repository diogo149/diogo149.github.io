#+END_EXPORT

After being tempted by a blogging solution that had more integration with org-mode - I've decided to move back to a jekyll-based solution. It isn't perfect, but the system is simple (in the sense that it's easier to understand what's going on) and forgiving (making it easy to resume if I stop) - both pretty nice things to have for what I'd like to be a low friction activity.
